The rainbow trout is one of the most well-known and widely distributed freshwater fish in the world. Native to the rivers and lakes of 
North America, it has been introduced to many countries due to its adaptability and popularity among anglers. The fish is named for the 
shimmering band of pink, red, and purple that runs along its silvery body, resembling the colors of a rainbow. Rainbow trout thrive in 
clear, cool, oxygen-rich waters and are often found in mountain streams, rivers, and large cold lakes. They are highly valued not only 
for sport fishing but also for aquaculture, as they grow quickly and provide nutritious, mild-flavored meat. The species shows remarkable 
resilience and can adapt to different environments, including both freshwater and, in the case of steelhead, the ocean. Rainbow trout play 
an important role in aquatic ecosystems, serving as both predators and prey. Their beauty, ecological importance, and cultural value make 
them one of the most iconic freshwater fish worldwide.
